# Dog-breed-Identification

## The project's goal

The objective of this Notebook is to detail the implementation of an algorithm for detecting the breed of the dog on a photo, in order to speed up the indexing work in a database.

## Constraints imposed:

- Pre-process the images with specific techniques (e.g. whitening, equalization, possibly modifying the size of the images).
- Perform data augmentation (mirroring, cropping...).
- Implementation of 2 approaches to the use of CNNs:
  - Realize a CNN neural network from scratch by optimizing the parameters.
  - Use transfer learning and thus use an already trained network.
